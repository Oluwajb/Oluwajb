# Car Stock Dashboard

This repository contains a **Car Stock Dashboard** built using **Streamlit** and **Plotly**. It allows users to filter and visualize car data, including key performance indicators (KPIs), distribution charts, and price analysis.

## Features

- **KPI Metrics**: Displays key statistics like average car price, total car count, and the earliest car model year.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Users can filter the data by:
  - Car manufacturer
  - Automation type
  - Usage category (Foreign/Local used)
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Bar Charts**: Shows price distribution per car color and per manufacturer.
  - **Pie Chart**: Displays the seat-make distribution.
  - **Histogram**: Visualizes the distribution of car manufacturing years.
  
## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web-based interactive dashboard.
- **Plotly Express**: For creating the bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.
- **Seaborn**: (Imported but not actively used).
- **Dask**: For array-based operations (Imported but not actively used).

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas streamlit plotly seaborn dask
   ```

2. **Running the Dashboard**:
   To run the Streamlit dashboard, use the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run <your_script_name>.py
   ```

3. **Data File**:
   - The dashboard expects the car data in a CSV file located at `C:/Users/HP/anaconda3/Lib/site-packages/win32/lib/cars.csv`. You can modify the file path to match your data location in the code.

## Usage

1. **Filtering Data**: 
   - Use the sidebar to filter the dataset by manufacturer, automation type, and use category (foreign/local used).
   - The filtered data will be reflected in the charts and KPIs.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - **Price per Color**: A bar chart showing total price per car color.
   - **Price per Manufacturer**: A bar chart showing total price per manufacturer.
   - **Seat Make Distribution**: A pie chart showing the distribution of cars based on seat make.
   - **Make Year Distribution**: A histogram showing the distribution of car make years.

## KPI Calculations

- **Average Price**: The mean price of the filtered cars.
- **Car Count**: The total number of cars available based on the selected filters.
- **Earliest Make Year**: The earliest car model year based on the filtered data.
